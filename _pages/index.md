I am a graduate student in Computing Science at the University of Alberta, where I work with Dr. Martha White on reinforcement learning research as part of the RLAI Lab and Amii. My background includes a BE in Software Engineering from NUST, where I graduated with distinction and received the Rector’s Gold Medal.

Before my graduate studies, I worked across computer vision, NLP, and large-scale ML systems in industry. At Vyro, I developed and optimized generative AI and image-processing pipelines used by millions of users, covering Stable Diffusion acceleration, segmentation, inpainting, and model-based image enhancement.

I later transitioned to NLP-focused work at Traversaal.ai, where I designed RAG pipelines, multi-modal agent systems, and contributed to low-resource language modeling under the LARGE initiative, including work on Urdu-LLaMA supported by the Meta APAC Accelerator Grant.

I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at ServeDen, where I work on a no-code platform for deploying secure, general-purpose LLM agentic workflows.

I was a MITACS research intern in Summer 2024, and a CERN Summer Student in 2024. I have published work at top-tier AI venues including ICML, COLING, EMNLP. I have been involved in industrial projects that combine applied ML engineering with reproducible research.
