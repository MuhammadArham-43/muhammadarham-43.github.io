I am a graduate student in Computing Science at the University of Alberta, working with [Dr. Martha White](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~whitem/) on reinforcement learning research as part of the [RLAI Lab](https://rlai.ualberta.ca/) and [Amii](https://www.amii.ca/). I hold a BE in Software Engineering from NUST, where I completed my Final Year Project with [Dr. Faisal Shafait](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o9RCNZYAAAAJ&hl=en) at the TUKL Lab and received the Rector's Gold Medal.

My research interests focus on reinforcement learning, generative-ai, and continual learning. I am particularly interested in developing methods for continual learning and decision-making in dynamic environments. I also have experience working on computer vision and NLP systems, with applications in generative AI, RAG pipelines, and multi-modal agent systems.

**Achievements:** CERN Summer Student 2024, MITACS Research Scholar 2023, Vector Graduate Scholarship Recipient _(withdrawn)_, NUST Rector's Gold Medal
